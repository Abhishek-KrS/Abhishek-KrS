ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning quantum algorithms and quantum programming languages.
ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open-source quantum computing projects.
ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with understanding quantum mechanics and advanced quantum computing concepts.
ðŸ’¬ Ask me about quantum software development, quantum programming, or anything related to quantum computing!
ðŸ“« How to reach me: You can reach me via email at abhishek-krs@alumni.iith.ac.in or connect with me on LinkedIn.
ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him/His/Xe
âš¡ Fun fact: I once attended a quantum computing conference where I got to meet some of the pioneers in the field!
